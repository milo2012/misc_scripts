### `xss_payload_numbering.py`

- Replaces `alert()` and `prompt()` calls in XSS payloads with uniquely numbered versions to help identify which payload triggered a vulnerability during Burp Intruder or fuzzing. For example, you can use the payload list from https://github.com/payloadbox/xss-payload-list/blob/master/Intruder/xss-payload-list.txt.
